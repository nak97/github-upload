<h2> what the science says about treatments </h2>
  <article> <i>Peter A. Mcullough </i> is a well known and highly acredited cardiologist and researcher at the <i>Texas A&M university.</i> In march of this year he gave a testimonial to the Texas senate about how treatable covid actually is. According to Mcullough We have over 500,000 deaths from Covid in the United states, and 85% of these deaths could have been prevented had they simply gotten early treatment. If we do the math thats 425,000 people that could have been saved. Unfortunately due to the government and big tech companies such as facebook, twitter, youtube, and other such social media platforms, treatment options have been illigally and <strong> unconstitutionally </strong>  censored and given the false claim of medical mis information.</article>  
  <h2> What possible treatments are there? </h2>

      <figcaption> This is one form of Ivermectin and is exactly what I used</figcaption>
      <br>
      <br>

 <article> There have been many studies done in regards to different treatment options available. Recently the government of Japan did a very intensive study on a treatment known as <strong>Ivermectin. </strong>
    Now for those who do not know<strong> Ivermectin</strong> has been used for decades as a treatment for various parasite born diseases. At first that does sound like it would have no effect on viruses.
    The Japanese did a study in Africa. They chose to do this study there because the Africans have been using this drug to protect them selves from the hazardous conditions that come with living in a third world country. 
    The study consisted of watching the countries that used <strong> Ivermectin </strong> and compared the amount of people who contracted the virus and also who died to the other countries that did not use <strong> Ivermectin. </strong>
    One thing that you should be aware of is that the FDA does not approve <strong> Ivermectin </strong> If you go to the FDA website shown <a href=https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19> here </a> and actually read why they do not apporve of it, its really not a big deal. 
    The main reason is that you can over dose on it, which is true. But did you know you can over dose on water? Depending on how you buy it, it comes with a medical syringe that lets you turn it to your weight and then gives you the dose. Which is exactly what I did and I had zero negative side effects. 
    Only positive ones. Alot of media platforms are extremely biased against anything that acts as a treatment and therefore an alternative to the jab. One thing that you should be aware of if you are not already is the covid shot was actually not FDA approved when it first came out. 
    It took several months for it to be approved. But before then millions of Americans had gotten the jab already.   </article> <br>
 <p class="info">As you will see in the information below, there is a significant difference in both the death rate and the rate of infection for the countries who use <strong>Ivermectin.</strong> </p>

      <table class="infoma">
        <tr>
          <th>
            countries who used Ivermectin
          </th>
          <th>
            countries who did not use Ivermectin
          </th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td><li> The countries who used Ivermectin experienced a death rate of 2.2 people per 100,000. </li>
        <li> The number of people infected was 134 per 100,000. </li></td>
        <td>
          <li> The death rate was 29.3 per 100,000</li>
          <li> The number of people who got infected were 950.6 per 100,000 people. </li>

      <h2> My recent experience with covid</h2> 
      
     <p> Many studies have been done regarding the effeciveness of natural immunity versus immunity given to you in a shot. All of these studies done indicate that those who recieve natural immunity by already having covid have a much greater immunity than someone who gets the jab. I know for a fact this is true because I have actually experienced this recently. I first got covid over a year ago while I was in college. It was not pleasant to say the least. fast forward to 3 weeks ago, my cousin who was fully vaccinated ended up getting covid. She then passed it on to my uncle when he was visiting her and it subsequently was passed on to me. Their symptoms were much worse than mine. I did not even get a fever. I did however have fatigue which is actually quite pleasant and I also lost my sense of smell and taste which was not so pleasant. Every one else in my family had much worse symptoms, they had aches, chills, fevers, and everything else. My uncle was the worst, his O2 level dropped to around 91. At this point he should have gone to the ER because his body was not getting enough oxygen. Luckily for us all he had some<strong> Ivermectin</strong> on hand, and he started taking the apporpriate dosage for his weight, and within a day his blood oxygen levels went back up to 98 which is normal. This is amazing, he has multple co-mobilities, he is fat and he also has diabeties. People like him are the most vulnerable to this virus and have a higher mortalilty rate than the average person. 
       
      <h2> Why I do not recommend you get the Jab</h2>  
      
      <article> I dont know if you have noticed, but I try to avoid calling the covid vaccine an actual vaccine. At best its it just an experimental drug. It clearly does not prevent you from getting covid like a normal vaccine would. So why even get it in the first place? I called the jab an experimental drug because in truth we dont know what the long term side effects are for this drug. It could very well cause people problems later on in life. There have not been any long term clinical trials done so there is no way to know if it is safe. Now I could justify getting this if covid had a mortality rate of 50% or something crazy like that. But as far I am aware the deah rate for covid is less than 1%. So why take such a risk for a virus that to 99% of the people who get it will survive and live full lives? It just does not make sense to me. Especially when this virus is completely treatable. I mean if my uncle can survive this then why cant most people who have co-mobidities? In truth, because of the mis information campain brought about by governments all over the world and also thanks to illigal censorship by media platforms many people have needlessly died who should not have simply because they did not know where to look for answers to their sickness. The goverment and the big tech componies have a lot of blood on their hands.
